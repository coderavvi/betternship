Please build a small fullstack mini app:
Requirements
A Node.js/Express API (backend) that manages a list of notes (hardcoded/mock data is fine — no database required).
Endpoints required:


GET /notes → returns all notes


POST /notes → create a note { id, title, content } (accept JSON, append to in-memory array)


PATCH /notes/:id → update a note's title and/or content


DELETE /notes/:id → delete a note


Example response for GET /notes:


[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Buy milk", "content": "2 liters" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "Call Sam", "content": "Discuss roadmap" }
]

A React app (frontend) that connects to that API and provides a small UI to:
List all notes on page load.


Create a new note (title + content).


Edit an existing note (inline or modal).


Delete a note.


You can use:
Node + Express for backend (hardcoded/mock in-memory array).


React with useState, useEffect, and fetch() for frontend.


Goal: Make sure both backend and frontend run and communicate correctly. Focus on clarity, correctness, and organization — UI styling can be minimal.
You have 50 minutes. Afterward, be ready to show the app and briefly explain what you built and what you'd improve with more time.
